Engine Overheating,  Engine temperature rises excessively due to coolant issues   radiator blockage   or malfunctioning thermostat   causing potential damage.  
Brake Failure,  Brakes lose efficiency due to worn pads   leaking fluid   or malfunctioning calipers   increasing accident risk.  
Flat Tire,  Tire loses air due to punctures   valve leaks   or wear   reducing vehicle stability and safety.  
Battery Drain,  Battery discharges quickly because of electrical issues   parasitic drain   or old age   preventing vehicle start.  
Transmission Slipping,  Automatic or manual transmission slips due to worn clutch or gearbox problems   causing erratic gear changes.    
Fuel Pump Failure,  Fuel pump malfunction causes poor engine performance   stalling   or inability to start the vehicle.   
Alternator Failure,  Alternator stops charging battery properly   causing dim lights   electrical failures   and battery drain.  
Spark Plug Issues,  Worn or fouled spark plugs lead to misfires   poor fuel efficiency   and rough engine performance.   
Steering Problems,  Steering becomes stiff or unresponsive due to power steering fluid leaks   worn linkages   or pump failure.   
Suspension Wear,  Worn shocks   struts   or bushings cause bouncy rides   poor handling   and uneven tire wear. 
Exhaust Leak,  Damaged exhaust system causes noise   harmful emissions   and reduced engine efficiency.   
AC Malfunction,  Air conditioning stops cooling due to refrigerant leaks   compressor failure   or electrical issues.   
Headlight Failure,  Lights dim or fail because of blown bulbs   wiring issues   or alternator problems   reducing visibility.  
Oil Leak,  Engine oil leaks from gaskets or seals   risking engine damage and fire hazards.    
Timing Belt Failure,  Broken or worn timing belt can cause severe engine damage and prevent starting.     
Overheating Radiator,  Radiator blockage or coolant loss causes engine overheating and potential breakdown.     
Wheel Alignment Issues,  Misaligned wheels cause uneven tire wear   vibration   and steering problems.   
Exhaust Smoke,  Excessive smoke from engine due to oil burn   coolant leak   or fuel system issues.   
Fuel Contamination,  Dirty or contaminated fuel affects engine performance   causing stalling or misfires.    
Clutch Slipping,  Slipping clutch causes loss of acceleration and irregular gear engagement.     
Power Loss,  Engine loses power due to air filter   fuel   or ignition system issues.   
Noise from Engine,  Unusual knocking   rattling   or squealing indicates worn components or lubrication problems.   
Tire Wear,  Uneven or rapid tire wear caused by poor alignment   suspension   or inflation issues.   
Door Lock Failure,  Central or manual locks fail due to actuator or wiring problems.     
Window Malfunction,  Power windows stop working due to motor or switch failure.     
Exhaust Smell,  Smell of fumes in cabin indicates leaks in exhaust or ventilation system.     
Coolant Leak,  Coolant leaks from hoses   radiator   or water pump   leading to overheating.  
Gear Shifting Problems,  Difficulty in changing gears caused by transmission   clutch   or linkage issues.   
Fuel Gauge Inaccuracy,  Fuel level readings are unreliable due to faulty sender or gauge problems.     
ABS Failure,  Anti-lock braking system malfunctions   reducing braking safety in slippery conditions.    
Turbocharger Failure,  Turbo fails to boost engine due to wear   oil issues   or mechanical failure.   
Engine Knock,  Pre-ignition or detonation causes knocking   risking severe engine damage.    
Steering Noise,  Squeaks or grinding in steering column due to worn joints or pump issues.     
Suspension Noise,  Clunks or rattles over bumps indicate worn suspension components.     
Head Gasket Leak,  Gasket failure causes coolant or oil mixing   leading to overheating and engine damage.    
Check Engine Light,  Illuminated warning light indicates various engine   emissions   or sensor issues.   
Fuel Injector Clogging,  Clogged fuel injectors reduce engine efficiency   cause misfires   and poor fuel economy.   
Radiator Fan Failure,  Fan stops working due to electrical or motor issues   causing engine overheating.    
Differential Noise,  Unusual whining or grinding from differential indicates worn gears or low lubrication.     
Brake Pad Wear,  Worn brake pads reduce stopping power and can damage rotors.     
Exhaust Muffler Damage,  Damaged muffler increases noise   reduces performance   and may fail emissions tests.
